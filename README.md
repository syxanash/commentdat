## About

Sometimes when reading an article I wonder if humanz have commented it somewhere, thus I created this extension to check if the article was submitted on popular websites like **Hacker News** or **Reddit**.

## How to use

Import the extension in `chrome://extensions`, then when you're reading an article click on the extension icon to check if the link has been commented.
